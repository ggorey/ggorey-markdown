* Some editing issues, all common, not *too* many. Watch out for those be verbs, prepositions, vague pronouns (e.g., "there seems to be some kind of constant debate").
* Not sure I'd imply that Netflix is a solution to college affordability. You can still argue that Netflix has educational value w/o calling it "an answer" to the affordability problem.
* Love the voice in your writing. Rhetorically effective.

## Post 2
* Editing again ("there are curriculums").
* Last section of the article could use more freeonlinecourses

## Post 3
* Maybe too much focus on food, but good

## Post 4
* Think I said this before, but I'm still not quite sure who the audience is.
* Editing ("there seems to be another level," "there are chosen topics")
