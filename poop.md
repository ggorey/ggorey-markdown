# This is not fun

I would like to be **outside**

In the nice *sunlight*

Perhaps sitting on the **drillfield** eating some *chips*

You know how Woody says:
> There's a snake in my boot

Here is a list of things I would *rather* be doing
1. sleeping
2. driving
3. existing outside
4. sleeping
5. eating some chips
6. watching *Toy Story*
7. sleeping
